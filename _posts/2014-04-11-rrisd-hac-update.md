On Friday morning (April 11, 2014), Round Rock ISD upgraded (and I use the term "upgraded" loosely) their Home Access Center version. This upgrade broke login across all versions of QuickHAC.

QuickHAC for Chrome version 2.2.4, which has been published to the Chrome Web Store, contains a fix that will re-enable all features in QuickHAC. The iOS and Android versions have fixes coming their way, but they will take a few days longer at least due to the slow nature of publishing on mobile platforms; Apple's review process in particular takes a very long time.

Without QuickHAC, you can still access your assignment grades. To do so in Home Access Center, click the "School Links" tab in the Week view, then click "Student Progress". This will bring up the familiar gradebook that you are used to. It's extremely unintuitive and poorly designed, but at least it's still there.

You can read more about the update [on the Round Rock ISD site](https://www.roundrockisd.org/UserFiles/Servers/Server_32715/File/HAC/RRISD%20Home%20Access%20Update%2004-11-2014.pdf).
