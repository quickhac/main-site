Today we are proud to announce an all-new QuickHAC, coming soon to Chrome, iOS, and Android! This is a huge update, and it's all thanks to our fabulous engineers who have been cranking gears at full speed behind the scenes for the past several weeks.

We've considered the tiniest details, like refining the typography, to much larger ones like redesigning all the icons. And developing a grid system allowed us to achieve a much more harmonius relationship between individual elements. We've also incorporated a whole new palette of colors.

While QuickHAC is completely new, it was important to us to make it instantly familiar. We wanted to take an experience that people know very well, and actually add to it, to make it more useful, to make it more enjoyable.

In addition to the redesigned user interface, QuickHAC 3 comes with some great new features and enhancements. 

## A Whole New Level of Fast

Everything has been reprogrammed from the ground-up to ensure that retrieving grades is as fast as we can possibly make it. The old QuickHAC relied on some sluggish trickery to work just right, which we realized was completely unnecessary.

## Additional Districts

QuickHAC was originally built for and by students in Round Rock ISD in Austin, Texas. Recently we expanded support to Austin ISD. QuickHAC 3 allows us to more easily support these districts and many more to come in the future.

## Multiple Students

In the past it has been a pain to keep track of multiple students with QuickHAC. Now QuickHAC automatically keeps track of as many students as you'd like. We think this is an indispensable feature to parents of multiple children.

## Visualizations and Goals

If you were an early user of QuickHAC, you may remember when we released grade colorization (under a different name, which, although was meant as a joke, probably was not very politically correct). Grades were colored according to their *severity*, however we realized that not all courses should be treated the same. In order to make QuickHAC 3 even more useful, we're announcing a new **Goals** feature. By setting a semester goal for a course, QuickHAC will automatically indicate how each assignment or assessment helps or hurts your progress towards that goal. In addition to these enhanced visualizations, QuickHAC can automatically calulate what minimum score you need to make on your next test in order to achieve your goal. Long gone are the days of repeatedly punching guesses into your calculator to find out that minimum score.

## GPA Calculator

What would be a great grade tool without a GPA calculator? We think it would no longer be great. This is why we've paid special attention to the GPA calculator in QuickHAC 3. Setting which courses are included is a breeze.

## Better Grade Editing

Planning on retaking that test you bombed? Did a teacher accidentally put in the wrong score? Grade editing allows you to see what you could make or should have made in the course if you had a different score on an assignment or assessment. QuickHAC 3 now supports many new assignment metadata, including marking items as dropped, missing, or extra credit, adding notes, specifying weighting, and adjusting points earned and points possible.

QuickHAC 3 brings with it the most significant changes we've made to the user interface since the introduction of the very first version of QuickHAC. To create it, we brought together a broad range of expertise from design to engineering. With what we've been able to achieve together, we see QuickHAC as defining an important new direction, and in many ways, a beginning.

We are excited to see what you think of our latest efforts! Thanks to all our fabulous supporters for helping us make QuickHAC 3 a reality. Expect to hear back from us soon for release announcements!
